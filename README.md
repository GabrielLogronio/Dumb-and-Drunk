# Dumb-and-Drunk
Project for the course "Videogame design and programming" at Politecnico di Milano. The game focuses on original and innovative player movements and controls.
The user is given on screen an analog stick and 4 buttons. Each button is randomly connected to a limb of the user's character (i.e. a button controls the right arm, another button controls the left leg, ecc).
To move the user must move the analog and press a button: the limb connected to the button will move in the direction given by the analog. 
The effect is a complicated mechanism that mimics the movement of a drunk person is not fully able to walk properly.
Other gameplay aspects add further complexity (a bar indicates the current balance of the user: if he is falling to the right he must move accordingly to regain his balance).
